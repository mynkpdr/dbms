
## Instructions:
Note: Do not hard code the database name in your program, because your program will be run against a different database instance for evaluation. 


For the database connection, use the following connection string variables:



database = sys.argv[1]	//name of the database is obtained from the command line argument

user = os.environ.get('PGUSER') 

password = os.environ.get('PGPASSWORD') 

host = os.environ.get('PGHOST')

port = os.environ.get('PGPORT')

## Problem Statement:
![ISBN](https://iitmpod-staging.appspot.com/test_course1/assets/img/bookca.PNG)  
Write a Python program to print the ISBN numbers of books which are published in a given year. Here, the year is obtained as the value of function L(x) (given after the sample output) at x. You have to read the value of x from the input file "number.txt", and use it to find the value of L(x). Your program must assume that the file number.txt resides in the same folder as your Python program.


You have to iterate through the list and print each value separately as shown in the output below: 

9789352921171
9789351343202
9789353333380
The line function is given below:
L5(x) = 2000 + 5*x + 5


## Solution:
```python
import psycopg2
import sys
import os

f = open("number.txt", "r")


database = sys.argv[1]

user = os.environ.get('PGUSER') 

password = os.environ.get('PGPASSWORD') 

host = os.environ.get('PGHOST')

port = os.environ.get('PGPORT')

con = psycopg2.connect(
dbname=database,
host=host,
user=user,
password=password,
port=port
)

cur = con.cursor()

details = []
for x in f.readline():
    x = 2000 + 5*int(x)+5
    cur.execute(f"select ISBN_no from book_catalogue where year = {x}")
    details.append(cur.fetchone())

for i in details:
    print(i[0])

cur.close()
con.close()
```
